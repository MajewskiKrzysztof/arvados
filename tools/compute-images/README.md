# Arvados Compute Node Image Builder

This directory includes templates to build custom cloud images for Arvados compute nodes. For instructions, refer to the [Arvados cloud compute node image documentation](https://doc.arvados.org/install/crunch2-cloud/install-compute-node.html).

## Development

If you are developing the Ansible playbook, note that you can test it by [running the Ansible playbook independently](https:///doc.arvados.org/install/crunch2-cloud/install-compute-node.html#ansible-build) of Packer. You just need a basic Debian or Ubuntu machine to run the playbook on.
